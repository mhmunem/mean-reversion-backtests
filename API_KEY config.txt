Here are the steps to set the environment variable:

1. Obtain Quandl API Key:
If you haven't obtained a Quandl API key yet, you need to sign up for a Quandl account and obtain an API key from the Quandl website.

2. Set QUANDL_API_KEY:
Set the QUANDL_API_KEY environment variable. You can do this in your terminal or command prompt. Replace 'YOUR_QUANDL_API_KEY' with your actual Quandl API key.

For Linux/Mac:
export QUANDL_API_KEY=YOUR_QUANDL_API_KEY

3. Try the Ingestion:
After setting the environment variable, retry the Zipline ingestion command:

zipline ingest -b quandl

4. Make sure to replace 'YOUR_QUANDL_API_KEY' with your actual Quandl API key. After setting the environment variable, Zipline should be able to access Quandl data during the ingestion process.

5. To check data has been ingested:

zipline bundels

it will show all the bundels that has been ingested.
